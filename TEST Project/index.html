            Derek Shepherd was a renowned neurosurgeon, former Head of Neurosurgery, and board director at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. He was married to Meredith Grey and they have two daughters, Zola and Ellis, and a son, Bailey. <br> Derek is regarded
            as one of the best neurosurgeons in the world. His services result in two million dollars worth of annual revenue for the hospital. He is a "tumor junkie" and has performed numerous complicated, risky procedures, including a stand-still operation,
            two double-barrel brain bypasses, and separation surgery for adult conjoined twins.

                Early Life
            </h3>
            <p>
                Derek spent most of his life prior to his arrival in Seattle in New York City. Derek and his sisters attended a French Preschool. As a child, Derek had no hair products, so he had a large afro, acne, a weight of 110 pounds, and played the saxophone in
                the school band. He was raised by a single parent, his mother Carolyn, along with his four sisters: Nancy, Kathleen, Liz, and Amelia. Like Derek, all four of his sisters are doctors. His father owned a shop when he was younger, and one
                day two robbers approached him and demanded that he give up the watch his wife Carolyn had saved tirelessly to buy for him. When he refused, the robbers shot him to death, with Derek and his younger sister Amelia bearing witness to his
                death while hiding in the back of the store. This event forms a large part of Derek's moral compass and consequently may have inspired him to become a surgeon to help save lives. As a result, he is especially cynical when treating criminals
                and feels that they do not deserve any compassion from him. While in high school, Derek played hockey. One day, he pushed his friend into the wall and his friend got hurt, but got up and continued to play. It wasn't until the next day
                that he found out that he developed a brain bleed. He was left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life. Every month, Derek sent money to his friend's mother to help pay for his long-term care. Derek's childhood best friend was Mark
                Sloan, who came from a wealthier but emotionally deficient background and was like a second son to the Shepherd family. Derek used to ride a motorcycle, but after an accident that gave him a scar, he stopped doing so. Derek went to Bowdoin
                College in Maine for his undergraduate years. He then attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons with Addison and Mark. During his medical education, Derek was taught by Richard Webber.
